Tools and Scripts for topological data analysis techniques on a data set representing semantic space.
Written in Python.

We have put together a jupyter notebook titled "jaccard\_analysis" so you can see exactly how this method works in practice and so you can visualise the data. You will need to run this notebook in a python environment with the necessary packages installed and in the same folder as the included "analysis\_tools.py". The notebook first loads the already formatted data. There is then a section where you can choose which groundings to compare by changing the "columns\_to\_keep" list.
The code then computes the Jaccard curves for all selected groundings, you can change the variable "param" to any value in $[0,1]$ this will calculate the area truncated at different points and may be useful to calibrate sensitivity. Then we display a heat map of the pairwise Jaccard distances between groundings. In the preloaded example see that OLD and PLD are very similar which should match intuition, similarly Gustatory and Mouth are similar. The notebook then walks you through an example of combining the two groundings Valence and Arousal to make Emotion and compares them with interoception. This is an exaple of the implemetaion of a possible merge product which is a tool we dont have in a traditional statistical analysis.
